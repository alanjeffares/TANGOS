## TANGOS: Regularizing Tabular Neural Networks through Gradient Orthogonalization and Specialization

### Getting Started With TANGOS


### Experiments
**Contents**
These folders are associtated with the commented experiments from the paper.
```
└── src
    ├── behavior-analysis            # TANGOS Behavior Analysis.
    ├── compute                      # Approximation and Algorithm.
    ├── in-tandem-regularization     # Generalisaton: In Tandem Regularization.
    ├── larger-data                  # Performance With Increasing Data Size.
    └── stand-alone-regularization   # Generalization: Stand-Alone Regularization.
```

The main experiments can be run by navigating to the root folder and running the following command.

```python src/<experiment name>/main.py```

The behavior analysis and compute expirements are included in ```.ipynb``` notebooks with instructions included.
